// user selects main ingredient from drop-down menu
// user then selects from a checklist of allergens
// based on user selections, make an API call to go through the array of recipes on mealdb.com and return all the objects (recipes) that contain selected main ingredient and do NOT contain the selected allergen(s) to an array filteredRecipes
// listen for user selection on an object in filteredRecipes

//STACK OVERFLOW ANSWER:








// Use jQuery.when() to wait for all requests to complete, and provide
// the responses in order (this is the purpose of $.when() or Promise.all()).
// Note that $.when() expects multiple arguments so we need accomodate that
// by spreading our array with Function.prototype.apply(). (This could be
// written more simply in ES2015 as $.when(...requests)).


$.when.apply(null, requests)
  // done() is called after all requests are complete. All responses are
  // passed as arguments in the order the requests were sent.
  .done(function() {
    // Loop through all arguments. Using a `for` loop because built-in
    // `arguments` object isn't a real array, so we can't use
    // arguments.forEach().
    for (var i=0; i<arguments.length; i++) {
      var response = arguments[i];
      // Response is an array, the first element is the user object we want.
      var user = response[0];
      console.log(users[i] + " == " + user.display_name);
    }
  })
  // If any request fails, it will be handled here.
  .fail(function() {
    alert('User request failed.');
  });
